Custom Flexbox Grid System Used in Paradigm Websites

Author's Note: I've been working on this for a short time and it has taken on a few variations. I found many of the Flexbox frameworks to be too bloated and contain far more features than I was really wanting. Instead, I created this group of CSS rules, using Sass as a CSS extension in order to keep the code clean and concise. The minified file is simply a Codekit compressed version of the same code.

I'll update the framework periodically, but I'd love to see if someone can improve and expand on the work â€“ while maintaining the simplicity and lightweight structure that's been employed.

Cheers.
